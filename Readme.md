# Classic Models Sample Database for SQLite

This is an exact copy of the 'classicmodels' database from https://www.mysqltutorial.org/.

The only changes are:

1) The database creation statement is removed
2) MySQL single quote escapes ("\'") are replaced with the appropriate escapes for SQLite ("''")
